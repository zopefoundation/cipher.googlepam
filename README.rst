Google PAM Module (defunct)
===========================

This package used to implement a PAM module to authenticate users against a
Google domain.

It is now utterly broken and allows anyone to authenticate with any password
they provide: https://github.com/zopefoundation/cipher.googlepam/issues/1

**DO NOT USE THIS PACKAGE**
